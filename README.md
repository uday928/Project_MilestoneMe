# MilestoneMe

## Project Overview
**MilestoneMe** is a platform designed to **bridge the gap between students and faculty in the coding journey**.  
The idea is to help students track their learning progress, showcase milestones, and get guided support from faculty through an organized dashboard.  

With MilestoneMe, students can:
- Log and track coding milestones across different platforms.
- Get personalized suggestions to improve their skills.
- Collaborate and share progress with faculty/mentors.
- Stay consistent and motivated in their coding journey.

Faculty can:
- Monitor student progress effectively.
- Provide timely feedback and resources.
- Identify strengths and weaknesses at a glance.
