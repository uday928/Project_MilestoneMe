# MilestoneMe

## Project Overview
**MilestoneMe** is a platform designed to **bridge the gap between students and faculty in the coding journey**.  
The idea is to help faculty to track their students' learning progress, showcase milestones, and give guided support to students through an organized dashboard.  

Faculty can:
- Monitor student progress effectively.
- Provide timely feedback and resources.
- Identify strengths and weaknesses at a glance.
- see multiple visuals for particular student regarding his/her journey
- send automate/manual notifications to motivate students to actively perform
- detect inactive students
